        <p>For my level 3 design, we had to come up with a campaign to help promote our issue or event that we decided to do. My idea was to promote animal testing in New Zealand with a protest, and at this protest you could donate, buy merchandise and show support for the issue. Below was my brief.</p>
        
    <p>RSPCA are hosting a protest in oriential bay and the Wellington harbour on the 19th April 2018, to try and change the regulations and laws surrounding animal testing within New Zealand. The aim of this protest is to bring attention to the issue of animal testing for medical reasearch. At the protest event, RAAT plan on selling bags and Tshirts, these funds will go towards putting a stop to animal testing in NZ.</p>
        
        <p>Below you will find a map which is outlining where abouts the protest is going to take place, and where the RAAT headquarters is located in Wellington.</p>

        <p> For my brief in level 3 design, we had to come up with an issue/event within New Zealand, and somehow create a campaign that would promote this idea to others. My idea was animal testing in New Zealand because not many people are aware that animals are tested on for medical research in NZ. My companies logo was RAAT, which stands for React Against Animal Testing.  </p>
        
    <p>RAAT stands for React Against Animal Testing. This is an organisation put together by the RSPCA to put a stop to all animal testing within New Zealand.  </p>
        
        <p> In New Zealand animals have the right of freedom from any suffering. The Animal Welfare Act makes it illegal to purposefully abuse an animal. This law however does not protect all animals, as some are used in research, testing and experimentations. Many animals are subjected to painful and distressing procedures, which would put you in jail if the animal were a cat or a dog. </p>
        
        <p> In 2016 there was a “39% increase in the number of animals suffering in experiments”. Institutions that carry out experiments on animals for medical research are Auckland University Medical School, Cancer Society, Liggins institute and Living Cell Technologies. </p>
        
        <p> The most common species used in the animal testing’s are mice, rabbits, guinea pigs and protected birds. In 2012 almost 17,000 animals were involved in procedures undergoing ‘severe suffering’. The RSPCA are putting together a campaign to stop all animal testing within New Zealand.</p>
